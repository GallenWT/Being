# 🧠 BEING  
**An Anxiety-Focused Journaling App for Mental Clarity**

## 📖 Description  
**BEING** is a note-taking app specifically designed to help users manage anxiety through a comprehensive journaling approach. The app supports users in organizing their thoughts, understanding emotional triggers, and fostering mindfulness through daily writing.

It offers three distinct journaling types:  
- 🌀 **Thought Dump Journal** – A safe space to unload worries and mental clutter, helping reduce stress  
- 📋 **Preparation of the Day** – Helps users plan and organize their tasks and goals, providing a sense of structure and control  
- 🌙 **End of the Day Reflection** – Encourages users to review their day, recognize wins, and reflect on areas of improvement  

In addition to journaling:  
- 📊 **Anxiety Check-In** – A daily tool to track anxiety levels and log emotional states, helping users identify patterns, triggers, and trends in their mental health
